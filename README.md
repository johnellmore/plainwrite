# Plain writer 

This is a distraction-free, no-frills, locally-runnable writing interface. It's a single HTML file that you can download and run on your machine, with no concerns about trackers, ads, or folks snooping on your writing.

**Try it: [write.johnellmore.com](https://write.johnellmore.com/)**. Feel free to use it for actual writing, if you trust me.

**Run it yourself:** save [`write.html`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnellmore/plainwrite/main/write.html) to your computer and open it.

*Pro tip: In Firefox, you can press Cmd+S (or Ctrl+S) to save the page and all of your writing into a single HTML file.*
